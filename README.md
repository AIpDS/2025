HICSS 58 Minitrack in the Research Track: Decision Analytics and Service Science 

## Description

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the management of connectivity between devices and sensors, enabling more effective problem analysis, risk mitigation, and deeper insights into complex systems. The integration of AI into manufacturing and infrastructure enhances decision-making by detecting anomalies, assessing risks, and triggering appropriate responses based on the risk level. Significant progress has been made in developing AI-driven methods and models to improve the accuracy of problem identification within large datasets, empowering experts with actionable insights.

This minitrack focuses on pioneering approaches that extract valuable knowledge from high-frequency data sources—such as IT data centers, energy service companies, and medical diagnostics—to enhance productivity, reduce downtime, and personalize treatment. General Topics Covered in this minitrack:

* AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) for short-text analysis
* Advanced AI-powered anomaly detection techniques
* Enhanced AI-based filtered selection approaches
* Machine learning methodologies for rare-event detection
* AI-driven risk assessment frameworks
* Novel AI methodologies for event-triggering mechanisms
* Strategies for handling unbalanced data in data science
* Generative AI models for field-support chat applications
* AI algorithms for detecting environmental changes

Potential Application Fields:

* IT data centers
* Transmission lines
